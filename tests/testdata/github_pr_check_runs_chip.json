This way, it's low-noise, but still allows you to detect critical problems early and fix them before they’re merged!\r\n\r\n![](https://lgtm.com/static/images/github-app/github-app-checks.png)\r\n\r\n### Prioritized alert overview\r\nView the alerts for the latest commit of your project, smartly prioritized based on the alert severity, your project history, and the behaviour of developers across over 130,000 repos. Extensive filters also allow you to focus on the results that are most important to you.\r\n\r\n![](https://lgtm.com/static/images/github-app/github-app-alerts.png)",
